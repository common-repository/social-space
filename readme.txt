A ridiculously simple plugin for showing your social network links using a simple widget so that people can connect with you more easily.

== Description ==

**Social Space** is a very light weight widget that will help you to easily share your social links. When you activate this plugin widget, you'll see 'Social Space' appear in the widget's list. Just drag and drop it wherever you wish to show your social links on the website.

Within the widget, you can add a 'Title' that will appear on the website as widget's title. Then there is a list of different social networking websites where you can directly link them to your social profile by simply providing your profile URL in the given area. Only those social icons will be displayed on your website for which you have added your profile link/URL.

For example - If you provide links only for Twitter, Skype, Instagram and leave all the other blank, then you'll only see Twitter, Skype and Instagram icons appear on the website. So its easily customizable and you can 'Choose what you want to Share'


### Features And Options:
* Customizable icon shapes.
* Supports 11 major popular social icons.
* 3 different and attractive rollover (hover) effects for icons.
* Ridiculously simple and easy to customize.
* Light weight plugin.


Note: Be sure to enter the URL for each social site by starting with 'http://' or 'https://' (Example: http://www.navkarya.com/) in order to make the social icons properly link to your social profile.
